# Pássaro Search
[Pássaro](https://p4ssaro.github.io/) is a metasearch engine that serves as an universal search box for 50+ search engines and websites, not needing to visit each specific website, instead, just typing its name and be redirected to this website with the search you made in Pássaro's search bar.

Occasional updates throught the year and massive update waves on April of each year.

Onion only, country restricted and non-english only search engines are not included nor will be, that is why Haystack\*, Qwant\*, Baidu\* and others aren't included.

- 1* Torry and others have clearnet search by the way, so this doesn't apply to it

- 2* It isn't even avaliable on my country so I definetly won't add it until it stops being country-restricted

- 3* Yandex search, even though it is Russian, has an English version, while Baidu doesn't

The list of search engines can be found on the documentation page of the website, at p4ssaro.github.io/docs.

## Next in line

These are the next search engines in the line to be added for Pássaro. They are stil to be reviewed to see if they are really worthy of being added to the website. Most of them are small, isolated, indie search engines and are probably not well established or polished, or are an extremely new startup that is not proven itself. Here is the list:

- Boardreder
- VHSearch
- Metaphor
- Childishsm
- Newgle
- Old'aVista
- BananaSlug
- deepweb_searching.htm
- Moonjump
- Oldest Search
- Carrot2
- Million Short
